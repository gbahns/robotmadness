## Session Summary - August 5, 2025

### Completed Refinements to Execution Log:

✅ **Fixed log order** - Changed from reverse chronological to standard chronological order (newest at bottom)
✅ **Added auto-scrolling** - Log automatically scrolls to bottom when new entries are added
✅ **Adjusted height** - Changed from 600px to 396px to properly align with game board
✅ **Fixed player names** - Removed "executes" from card execution messages (now shows "Alice MOVE 2" instead of "Player executes MOVE 2")
✅ **Added submission logging** - Players now see when they and others submit their programs
✅ **Added comprehensive server logging** - For debugging card submissions and execution flow

### Key Technical Discoveries:
- Found duplicate `handleCardExecuted` function that was never wired up (dead code)
- Clarified the actual socket handler being used for card execution events
- Identified that round separators weren't working due to closure issues (though decided they're not necessary given the visual separation from color coding)

### Files Modified:
1. `/components/game/ExecutionLog.tsx` - Height adjustment, auto-scroll, chronological order
2. `/app/game/[roomCode]/page.tsx` - Fixed card execution messages, added submission logging, attempted round separator fix
3. `server.js` - Added logging for submissions and execution, incremented roundNumber
4. `/lib/game/types.ts` - No changes needed
5. Various other files examined but not modified

### What Works Well:
- Execution log provides clear visibility into game actions
- Color coding (gray for info, blue for actions, red for damage, green for checkpoints) naturally separates rounds
- Player names display correctly in all log messages
- Auto-scrolling keeps latest actions visible
- Fixed height maintains visual alignment with game board

### Ready for Next Session:
The execution log is now fully functional and refined. Ready to work on improving the overall game screen layout to better utilize screen real estate!
