## Backlog
* lasers
* walls
* conveyor belts
* express conveyor belts
* pushers
* wrenches
* hammers
* starting space mini boards
* risky exchange board
* Prevent further changes after timer expires
* When timer hits 0, randomly fill empty registers
* show all players cards for the current register / incremental card reveal
* reduce the padding around the board to make better use of the space
* make the robot arrow black instead of white when the robot color is light
* move the legend to a separate component

## In Progress
* add a console that displays key log messages (player executes card, executing board elements, player takes damage)

## Done
* robots pushing each other
* during the execution phase move each robot one at a time
* remove the Game Board title
