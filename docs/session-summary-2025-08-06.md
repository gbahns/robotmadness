Excellent work on consolidating the duplicate logic! This was a productive session where we:

## Session Summary:

### 1. **Identified the duplicate executeRegister implementations**
- Found that `submit-cards` handler was calling the wrong (incomplete) version
- Discovered `executeRegisters` function existed but wasn't being used
- Successfully migrated to use `gameEngine.executeRegister`

### 2. **Cleaned up duplicate code between server.js and gameEngine.js**
- Removed duplicate `moveForward` function (in favor of `moveRobot`)
- Consolidated direction vectors
- Identified which functions belong where (game setup vs game mechanics)
- Removed the duplicate `executeRegister` from server.js

### 3. **Improved architecture separation**
- server.js now handles: socket events, game management, card dealing
- gameEngine.js handles: all game mechanics, movement, board elements
- Clear separation of concerns achieved

The codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable with proper separation between server orchestration and game logic. The game execution should work correctly with the full gameEngine implementation including collision detection, pushing, and board elements.

Great job on implementing these changes! The game is in a much better state now. ðŸŽ‰
