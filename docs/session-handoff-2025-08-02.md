# Session Handoff - August 2 2025 8:30 PM

## What We Just Accomplished in This Session

### Fixed Critical Issues
1. **Game Page Display**: Was completely broken, now shows:
   - Game board (12x12 grid)
   - Player status panels with hearts and health bars
   - Program registers area
   - Player hand of cards

2. **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed all type errors in:
   - `socket.ts` - Added missing methods (selectCards, submitCards)
   - `Board.tsx` - Fixed JSX namespace issue
   - `page.tsx` - Fixed method calls

3. **Runtime Error**: Fixed "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'width')"
   - Board was not initialized in game state
   - Added proper board initialization in server.js

4. **Server Startup**: Fixed "io is not defined" error
   - Restructured server.js with proper initialization order

### Components Created/Fixed
- `Robot.tsx` - NEW: Displays player robots with direction
- `PlayerStatus.tsx` - NEW: Shows player info with visual health
- `Timer.tsx` - NEW: Countdown timer with animations
- `Board.tsx` - FIXED: Now handles null board gracefully

## What Was Working Before (DO NOT CHANGE)

### Already Established Features
- Room creation with shareable codes
- Multiple players can join same room  
- Host (first player) can start game
- Cards are dealt when game starts
- Socket.io real-time communication
- Player names and IDs persist

### UI That Should Not Change
- Board is 12x12 grid (600x600px)
- Tiles are exactly 50px each
- Player panels show on left side
- Cards/controls on right side
- Dark theme (gray-900 background)

## Current Task Status

### What We Were Working On
**Card Selection UI** - Making cards selectable to place in program registers

### Current Problems
1. **Clicking cards doesn't work properly**
   - The click handler exists but has bugs
   - Selected slot state management is confusing

2. **Drag and drop is broken**
   - DnD providers are set up but not functioning
   - May be conflicting with click selection

3. **Submit validation missing**
   - Can submit without filling all registers
   - No visual feedback for incomplete programs

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Fix card click selection:
   ```typescript
   // Current broken flow:
   // 1. Click register slot to select it
   // 2. Click card to place it
   // This needs debugging
   ```

2. Add proper validation before submit

3. Show better visual feedback for selected slots

## Critical Information for Next Session

### DO NOT ATTEMPT
- Animations (broke everything last time)
- Board element execution (not ready)
- Major refactoring of working components
- Adding new dependencies
- Changing board size or tile size

### SAFE TO MODIFY
- Card selection logic in `page.tsx`
- Click handlers for cards and registers
- Submit validation logic
- Error messages and user feedback
- Visual states (selected, hover, etc.)

### Current File States

#### Working Well - Don't Restructure
- `/server.js` - Socket.io server (line 5 issue is FIXED)
- `/components/game/Board.tsx` - Displays board correctly
- `/components/game/PlayerStatus.tsx` - Shows player info nicely
- `/lib/socket.ts` - Has all needed methods

#### Needs Attention
- `/app/game/[roomCode]/page.tsx` - Card selection logic buggy
- `/components/game/ProgramRegisters.tsx` - Slot selection confusing
- `/components/game/Card.tsx` - Click vs drag conflict

#### Not Yet Connected
- `/gameEngine.js` - Exists but not imported/used
- `/boardConfig.js` - Has board data but minimal integration

## Key Functions That Need Work

### handleCardClick (page.tsx)
```typescript
// Currently tries to:
// 1. Check if slot is selected
// 2. Check if card already placed
// 3. Place card in selected slot
// 4. Auto-advance to next slot
// BUT IT'S BUGGY
```

### handleRegisterClick (page.tsx)
```typescript  
// Should:
// 1. Select the clicked register slot
// 2. Visual feedback for selection
// 3. Not select locked registers
// NEEDS BETTER IMPLEMENTATION
```

## Environment Details
- **Node Version**: Works with Node 18+
- **Start Command**: `npm run dev`
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **No Database**: Using in-memory storage
- **No Auth**: Using sessionStorage for player ID

## Known Good Test Flow
1. Open two browser windows
2. First player creates game (gets room code)
3. Second player joins with room code
4. First player (host) clicks "Start Game"
5. Both players see dealt cards
6. [BROKEN] Players select cards for registers
7. [BROKEN] Players submit programs

## Error Patterns to Avoid
1. **Don't** add `webkit-transform` or browser prefixes
2. **Don't** use `JSX.Element` (use `React.ReactElement`)
3. **Don't** call `startGame(roomCode)` - it takes no params
4. **Don't** assume board exists - always check

## Questions for Next Session Start
1. Should we fix click selection or switch to pure drag-drop?
2. Is the selected slot indicator clear enough?
3. Should locked registers show cards from previous round?
4. Do we want to allow deselecting cards?

## Recommended First Task for Next Session
```typescript
// In page.tsx, simplify handleCardClick:
const handleCardClick = (cardIndex: number) => {
  // 1. Get the card
  // 2. Find first empty register
  // 3. Place card there
  // 4. Update state
  // Skip the "selected slot" complexity for now
};
```
