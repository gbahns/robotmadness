# Pusher Functionality Test Plan

## What's Implemented

1. ✅ **Test pushers added** to Risky Exchange Docking Bay at positions (4,0) and (7,0)
   - Pusher at (4,0): Direction DOWN, active on registers [1, 3, 5]
   - Pusher at (7,0): Direction DOWN, active on registers [2, 4]

2. ✅ **Visual rendering** - Red arrow-shaped tiles showing push direction and register numbers

3. ✅ **Tooltip information** - Hover shows "Pusher" type and "Active on registers: X, Y, Z"

4. ✅ **Game engine integration** - `executePushers()` function activates pushers based on current register

## How to Test

1. **Select Course**: Choose "Risky Exchange" course
2. **Start Game**: Place robots at or near pusher tiles (positions 4,0 and 7,0)
3. **Program Cards**: Submit cards to reach execution phase
4. **Watch Execution**:
   - Register 1: Pusher at (4,0) should activate, pushing robot DOWN
   - Register 2: Pusher at (7,0) should activate, pushing robot DOWN  
   - Register 3: Pusher at (4,0) should activate again
   - Register 4: Pusher at (7,0) should activate again
   - Register 5: Pusher at (4,0) should activate again

## Expected Behavior

- Robots on pusher tiles get pushed in the direction the pusher points
- Pushers only activate during their designated registers
- Push movement follows same collision rules as robot movement (blocked by walls/robots)
- Visual indicators show which registers each pusher is active on

## Visual Verification

- Pusher tiles should appear as red arrow-shaped tiles
- Small yellow text in corner shows active registers (e.g., "1,3,5")
- Tooltip on hover shows detailed information

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
