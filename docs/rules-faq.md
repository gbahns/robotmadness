Frequently Asked Questions for Robo Rally
Reentering Play:
Q: What do you do when you go to place your robot after a death and
the square with your archive marker is full and all adjacent spots are
illegal (pit/off board/occupied/has line of site within three spaces in all
directions)?
A: Expand out to the next band of spaces encircling the archive space.
Q: In what order should players place their robots onto the board after
death if they both died at the same time (they are supposed to replace
their robots in the order they died, but lasers are simultaneous, as are
conveyors into pits)?
A: Do it in order of where the robots started on the Docking Bay.
Mechanical Arm:
Q: What happens if both players touch the last flag at the same time?
This can happen when one player has mechanical arm and uses it to
touch a space next to them (in this case, a flag) while another player
actually lands on the space.
A: Both players win (It's a tie.)
Q: With mechanical arm, does the player choose which location to
touch or can the player touch them all at the same time?
A: The player chooses one.
Q: When using Mechanical Arm to touch a different square do you still
count as touching the square you are on?
A: Yes. The Mechanical Arm's function isn't "instead of" the normal
rule.
Q: Can you get double healing/option cards from using Mechanical
Arm to touch an adjacent Wrench/Hammer while your robot is on a
Wrench/Hammer space?
A: Yes.
Q: Mechanical Arm says you can touch diagonally "as long as there
isn't a wall between it and the flag." If touching diagonally, will one
wall block, or do you need two to fill the corner?
A: The corner needs to be blocked by two walls.
Ramming Gear:
Q: If a conveyor tries to move a robot with ramming gear into another
(thus not moving either robot since conveyors won't push), does the
ramming gear do damage to the other robot?
A: No.
Q: If a robot with ramming gear and another robot are both on
conveyors and being moved to the same location (thus not moving),
would ramming gear do damage?
A: No.
Q: If a different robot pushes the Ramming Gear robot, does that
pushing robot take damage?
A: No.
Q: If one robot pushes the Ramming Gear robot into a third robot, is
that third one damaged?
A: No.
Fourth Gear and Reverse Gear:
Q: Can you use Fourth Gear or Reverse Gear in combination with Dual
Processor?
A: Yes. When you do the Dual Processor register, you are “executing”
both of those movement cards, which indicates that Reverse Gear and
Fourth Gear function.
Mini Howitzer and Pressor Beam
Q: Can the Mini Howitzer and/or Pressor Beam which push the
targeted robot back also move the robot behind it if it is in the way?
Or does this work like a conveyor and cannot push?
A: Yes, they also push robots behind the target. The Mini Howitzer and
Pressor Beam count as “pushing” the robot, while the conveyor
movement doesn’t.
Q: When two or more robots are moved by weapons, are these moves
simultaneous (meaning they can't be pushed into the same location
like conveyors) or ordered in some way (meaning one gets pushed to
the location, then the other either is pushed into it or doesn't move
depending on the answer to the question above)? If ordered, what
ordering?
A: Neither is pushed.
Locked Registers:
Q: What happens if a register with two cards in it becomes locked? If
they are both locked there, what happens if the option card that
allowed that is then lost?
A: Both are locked there. If the option card is lost, the function of the
card still affects that locked register until the register becomes
unlocked.
Q: What happens if the option allowing two cards in one register is lost
before a register it's used in (even when not locked)?
A: The function of the option card affects that register until those
cards are removed from the register.
Radio Control:
Q: If the player with Radio Control dies in the middle of a turn, do the
players he shot continue to execute his registers?
A: Yes.
Q: If you are radio controlled can you use a card like brakes when the
opponent's program tells you to move one?
A: Yes.
Q: It you are radio controlled and the opponent uses brakes to move
zero, do you move zero too or do you still move one?
A: You still move one.
Rear Firing Laser:
Q: Rear Firing Laser – if a player has this option card and also has
another option card that modifies their main laser, does this
modification also apply to their rear laser?
A: No. Cards like Fire Control, Pressor Beam, Radio Control, etc. don’t
modify the rear laser.
Abort Switch:
Q: If you use the option card Abort Switch, it lets you swap one card in
a register with a random one from the deck, and also for all remaining
registers. How would this interact with registers that have two cards?
Replacing one or both could result in an illegal combination.
A: Both program cards are replaced by the one Abort Switch card.
