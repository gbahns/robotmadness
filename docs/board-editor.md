Now let me create an enhanced board editor component that includes template loading and additional features:I've created a comprehensive board editor for RoboRally with the following features:

## Main Board Editor (`app/board-editor/page.tsx`)
- **Visual tile placement** with drag-and-drop support
- **Multiple tools**: Tiles, Lasers, Walls, Starting Positions
- **Real-time preview** with adjustable tile size
- **Grid overlay** with coordinates
- **Direction indicators** for conveyor belts, lasers, etc.

## Board Editor Utilities (`lib/game/board-editor-utils.ts`)
- **Board validation** with error and warning reporting
- **Board transformations**: rotate, mirror, resize
- **Statistics generation** for board analysis
- **TypeScript code export** for integration into the codebase
- **Board preview generation** for thumbnails

## Board Templates (`lib/game/board-templates.ts`)
- **Pre-made templates** including:
  - Empty 12Ã—12 board with starting positions
  - Simple race track with conveyor belts
  - Cross pattern with intersecting conveyors
  - Maze template with walls and obstacles
  - Laser gauntlet with hazards and repair sites

## Enhanced Board Editor (`components/BoardEditor.tsx`)
- **Undo/Redo system** with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
- **Template loading** with categorized templates
- **Real-time validation** with error highlighting
- **Board transformations** (rotate, mirror)
- **Multiple export formats** (JSON, TypeScript)
- **Zoom controls** for detailed editing
- **Statistics display** showing tile counts, etc.

## Key Features:
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Click to place tiles, drag to paint multiple tiles
2. **Professional Tools**: Wall placement with edge detection, directional elements
3. **Validation System**: Ensures boards are playable (starting positions, size limits, etc.)
4. **Template System**: Quick start with pre-designed board layouts
5. **Export/Import**: Save and share custom boards
6. **History System**: Full undo/redo with 50-state history
7. **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes

To use the board editor:
1. Place the components in your Next.js app
2. Navigate to `/board-editor` to access the tool
3. Select tools and tile types from the right panel
4. Click or drag on the board to place elements
5. Use templates for quick starting points
6. Validate and export your finished boards

The editor generates board definitions compatible with your existing game engine and can export both JSON data files and TypeScript code for direct integration into your project.
