## Session Summary - August 4, 2025

### Completed Features:
âœ… **Execution Log Console** (second backlog item) 
   - Shows card executions with priority
   - Logs register starts
   - Tracks robots falling off board
   - Records checkpoint reaches
   - Persists between rounds with separators
   - Always visible during gameplay

### Key Files Modified:
- **server.js** - Emit events to facilitate execution log
- **/app/game/[roomCode]/page.tsx** - Integrated ExecutionLog component and event handlers
- **/components/game/ExecutionLog.tsx** - Created for game action logging

### Technical Improvements:
- Updated our AI Partner Guide with new file delivery standards (75% rule, separate artifacts, clear instructions)
- Implemented minimal-change approach to protect working code

### Next Up: refine the Excecution Log
- set a fixed height and add a scrollbar so that it aligns with the bottom of the game board
- fix it so the player's name is displayed instead of "Player" for card execution
- remove the word "executes" from those messages (superfluous)

Great progress! The core execution mechanics are now in place with visibility into what's happening. The execution log will be invaluable for debugging as you add more complex board elements.
