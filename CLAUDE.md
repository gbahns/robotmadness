## Database Migration Instructions

### IMPORTANT: Use Existing Scripts
When performing database migrations, **ALWAYS** check and use the existing TypeScript migration scripts in the `/scripts` folder before creating new ones:

#### MongoDB to PostgreSQL Migration
1. **User Migration**: `scripts/migrate-users.ts`
   - Migrates users from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
   - Maps MongoDB user fields to Prisma schema
   - Preserves user IDs for relationship mapping

2. **Game Migration**: `scripts/migrate-games.ts`
   - Migrates games and game players from MongoDB
   - Uses `games_view` collection for complete data
   - Maps board IDs to names, robot IDs to colors
   - Correctly links hosts and winners

3. **Fix Scripts** (if needed after migration):
   - `scripts/fix-winner-mapping.ts` - Corrects winner relationships
   - `scripts/fix-games-migration.ts` - General game data fixes

#### Field Mappings (MongoDB â†’ PostgreSQL)
- **Users**:
  - Username comes from `players.name` field
  - `players.userId` â†’ `users._id`
  - Email from `users.emails[0].address`
  
- **Games**:
  - `games.userId` â†’ host user ID
  - `games.author` â†’ host username
  - `games.winner` â†’ winner username (lookup user by name)
  
- **Players**:
  - `players.gameId` â†’ `games._id`
  - `players.userId` â†’ `users._id`
  - `players.name` â†’ username

#### Migration Steps
1. Set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to target PostgreSQL database
2. Update MongoDB connection string in scripts if needed:
   - Old format: `mongodb://user:pass@shard1,shard2,shard3/db?ssl=true`
   - New format: `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/db`
3. Run migrations in order:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/migrate-users.ts
   npx tsx scripts/migrate-games.ts
   npx tsx scripts/fix-winner-mapping.ts  # if needed
   ```
4. Verify with: `npx tsx scripts/verify-users.ts` and `verify-games.ts`

## Development Environment

### Development Server
**IMPORTANT - DO NOT MANAGE DEV SERVER:** 
- The development server (`npm run dev`) should be managed manually by the user
- DO NOT attempt to start, stop, or restart the dev server
- DO NOT use the dev-server-manager agent
- If the user mentions the dev server isn't running, inform them they need to run `npm run dev` manually
- Focus on code changes only - the user will handle server management

### Testing and Building
- Use `npm run build` to check for TypeScript errors and build issues
- The project doesn't have a `typecheck` script; use `npm run build` instead
- Lint issues are shown during build but don't block compilation

## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Socket.io for real-time multiplayer
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prisma ORM (currently unused but configured)

### Key Directories
- `/app` - Next.js app router pages
- `/components` - React components
- `/lib` - Core game logic and utilities
- `/hooks` - Custom React hooks
- `/server.ts` - Socket.io server implementation

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Best Practices
- **NEVER use `any` type** - Always specify proper types
- Use union types (e.g., `string | number`) when values can be multiple types
- Define interfaces or type aliases for complex objects
- Properly type function parameters and return values
- If you absolutely need to bypass typing temporarily, use `unknown` instead of `any`

### Comments
- DO NOT add comments unless explicitly requested by the user
- Keep code self-documenting through clear naming

### UI/UX Principles
- Avoid modal dialogs for game decisions (see `/docs/UX-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md`)
- Use inline panels in the sidebar for player decisions
- Keep the game board visible at all times during gameplay

### Refactoring Approach
- When refactoring large components, prioritize:
  1. Extracting custom hooks for business logic
  2. Creating smaller, focused components
  3. Separating concerns (presentation vs logic)

## Current Refactoring Status

The game page (`/app/game/[roomCode]/page.tsx`) is being refactored to improve maintainability:
- âœ… Created `useGameSocket` hook to manage socket events
- ðŸ”„ Additional components to be extracted (see todo list)

## Testing Protocol

1. Check TypeScript compilation: `npm run build`
2. Verify no runtime errors in browser console
3. Test multiplayer functionality with multiple browser tabs
4. Ensure game state syncs properly between clients

## Known Issues & Considerations

- Some ESLint warnings are acceptable (unused vars in WIP features)
- The project uses both client and server components - be mindful of the boundary
- Socket.io events must be properly cleaned up in useEffect returns
